##InterReview

####**Idea:**
A website where users can post and rate their experiences with job interviews in any field.

####**Motivation:**
While still on my way to earning my bachelor’s, I have a bit of anxiety for the next hurdle I must pass to starting my career. That hurdle being the job interview. Between attending workshops for resume building and whiteboarding, I feel like I am slowly getting prepped for that moment. 
However, there will be no substitute for the actual experience of going through the 
interview gauntlet. What if there was one more way to prepare? A place where people 
could virtually see what going through that gauntlet is like.

My motivation for building this website, outside of the experience 
I will get from coding my own site, is to help everyone get a leg up for landing a 
position in their field. This site could be a free resource for users to see what 
others had to go through to get a similar job. I have friends who have shared their 
interview experiences with me, and it opened my eyes as to what to expect. The more 
equipped a person can be going into an interview, the more likely they are to have 
success. To be totally greedy, building this site will also force me to explore what 
I personally could do to prep for an interview.

####**Application:**
This site would be a repository of user’s experiences in their job interview(s). My 
initial ideas on how the site would function goes like this: Users will start by 
creating an account. When creating their accounts, users will select their career 
field as well as what job experience and education they have. From there they can 
either browse other’s interview reviews or post their own. Using a filter type search, 
users can narrow down the posts by what job field they are for.
